# Basic concepts
LoRa is a wireless technology just like WiFi or Bluetooth and the most important features compared to other technologies are:
-Interference tolerance.
-Low consumption.
-Long range, in ideal conditions more than 20 km.
-Low data transfer, until 255 bytes.
-Working frequencies: 868MHz in EU, 915MHz in USA and 433MHz in Asia
-It uses a type of modulation patented by Semtech called Chirp Spread Spectrum or CSS.

Note that LoRa and LoRaWan are not the same, LoraWAN is a network protocol that uses LoRa technology. LoRaWAN is a type of low power, wide area network (LPWAN). The main components of LoRaWAN are the gateways and the nodes:
- Gateway: receives and sends information  to the different nodes.
- Nodes: are the final devices that send and receive information to one or several Gateways.

In addition to the features inherited from LoRa , LoRaWAN adds some more:
- Secure two-way connections.
- Interoperability of the various LoRaWAN networks worldwide (Optional)
- More than 50.000 modes can be connected in a single network.
